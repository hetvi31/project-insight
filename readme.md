Can you tell me if there is a decrease or increase in sales across months

To determine if there's an increase or decrease in sales across months, we need to aggregate sales by month. The provided data doesn't directly show monthly totals, only individual order amounts and dates. To answer your question accurately, a monthly sales aggregation is required.
